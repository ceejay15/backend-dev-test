## The Test

### Part 1

The directory --- contains a simple HTML file. The file makes an AJAX request to a server. Open the file in Google Chrome and you'll notice that the request fails. You do not have access to the server. The server endpoint is ---. You're tasked with ensuring that the client code can access the API content at the provided server endpoint.

**Note**: _before starting, feel free to ensure the server is operational by running something similar to the following UNIX command:_

`$ curl -X GET https://---`
